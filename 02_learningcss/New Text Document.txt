Three ways we can use CSS:-
Inline CSS
Don't go for Inline CSS. You should separate your styling, you should keep styling out of your markup.
Inline CSS is much harder to read, to change, its not a good practice.

Internal CSS:
Its is still on the same page, on your html page but it is separate from your html. <style> </style>

External CSS:
Here you have separate file for your css. Through <link> tag you will link your styling to html file.
External CSS is the preferred one.
