# ISSUE:
I was committing to my GitHub repository from the Git terminal for some days. The commits were done successfully, but they were not shown on my activity graph. The problem was that the GitHub email and the Git config email I had provided were different. You can check it by using the command "git config user.email" in the terminal.
- git config --global user.email "imran1nawar@gmail.com"
- git config --global user.name "ImranNawar"
