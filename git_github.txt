ISSUE:
I was committing to my github repository from git terminal from some days, the 
commits was done successfully but it was not shown on my activity graph.
The problem was that my github email and git config email which I given was different.
check it by "git config user.email" in terminal 
git config --global user.email "imran1nawar@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "ImranNawar"
